Hi, I am _@ymurong_ (Yanchao, MURONG), currently working at Renault Infrastructure Integration Team as Backend Developer.

I studied Information System Management and graduated from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Institute_of_Technology) by 2013, and then came to France to continue my studies at [Toulouse 1 University Capitole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse_1_University_Capitole) and graduated with Mention B.

With a semi-technical-functional background, I am a passionate self-learner about new technologies and never stops to break my comfort zone to seek new challenges. 

##### My Current Job

As a full-stack web developer, software engineering is the core part of my daily work. Now I work on a marketplace-type application that allows end-users of the whole company to manage, expose and subscribe to web services for internal and external clients with close integration with api management, messaging brokers as well as access management.

My job consists of understanding the requirements of my stakeholders, transform the requirements into actionable tasks, designing and developing required modules, testing and validating the deliverables. I am also responsible for reviewing the whole application of its architecture, code quality and provide guidance for junior developers. 

##### Project Experience

I have been working on many types of projects with different languages. 

- Backend: NodeJS (express), Java (vertx), python (flask)
- Frontend: Angular (typescript), d3, echarts
- Devops (shell, ansible, terraform, cicd)
